 ## Install npm packages

Install the npm packages described in the package.json and verify that it works:<br>
```
npm install
npm start
```
The ```npm start``` command first compiles the application, then simultaneously ```re-compiles``` and runs the ```lite-server```. Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.
 Shut it down manually with ```Ctrl-C```.
You're ready to write your application.
## Running the tests>
TypeScript unit-tests are usually in the ```src/app``` folder. Their filenames must end in .spec.ts.
Look for the example ```src/app/app.component.spec.ts.``` Add more ```.spec.ts``` files as you wish; we configured karma to find them.
Run it with ```npm test ```
That command first compiles the application, then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the karma ```test-runner```. Both the compiler and the karma watch for (different) file changes.
Shut it down manually with ```Ctrl-C```.
Test-runner output appears in the terminal window. We can update our app and our tests in real-time, keeping a weather eye on the console for broken tests.<br> Karma is occasionally confused and it is often necessary to shut down its browser or even shut the command down ```(Ctrl-C)``` and restart it. No worries; it's pretty quick.
