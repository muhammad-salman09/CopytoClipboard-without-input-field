<h2>Prerequisits</h2> <br>
angular2 or anglar4 <br>
 MongoDB (database) <br>
 Mongo-Shell (shell) <br>
Node <br>
Express <br>
<h2> Installing</h2>
<br>
•	Angular: go to https://angular.io/guide/quickstart <br>
•	node.js: go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ <br>
•	mpongoDB: go to https://www.mongodb.com/download-center <br>
•	mongoshell: go to https://docs.mongodb.com/getting-started/shell/client/ <br>
•	npm pakages:go to https://www.npmjs.com <br>

<h2> Install npm packages</h2>
<br>
Install the npm packages described in the package.json and verify that it works:<br>
<p> npm install<br>
npm start </p><br>
<p>The npm start command first compiles the application, then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the lite-server. Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.<br>
Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C. <br>
You're ready to write your application.</p> <br>
<h2>Running the tests</h2> <br>
<p>TypeScript unit-tests are usually in the src/app folder. Their filenames must end in .spec.ts.<br>
Look for the example src/app/app.component.spec.ts. Add more .spec.ts files as you wish; we configured karma to find them.<br>
Run it with npm test <br>
That command first compiles the application, then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the karma test-runner. Both the compiler and the karma watch for (different) file changes.<br>
Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.<br>
Test-runner output appears in the terminal window. We can update our app and our tests in real-time, keeping a weather eye on the console for broken tests.<br> Karma is occasionally confused and it is often necessary to shut down its browser or even shut the command down (Ctrl-C) and restart it.<br> No worries; it's pretty quick.</p><br>
